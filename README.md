# Protocol for Unified Legal Services (PULSE)
## Introduction

Access to justice systems the world over is expensive and fragmented. Various organizations and justice makers serve different aspects of access to justice, including, services or products, and location/jurisdiction. Due to this,  it is important for seekers to access a holistic, unified experience, based on their needs. This includes: 
 
1. Finding trusted services (lawyers, counselors, social workers, paralegals, mediators, ODR, etc) 
2. Finding necessary products (Title search reports; contract management services, etc) 
3. Enabling seekers and/or justice makers to create and track a digital record/document of the support sought and the experience of seeking support 
4. Leveraging the data & knowledge through this process to influence trust, decision-making, policy, and interventions necessary 
 
Organizations and justice makers also seek to be empowered and interconnected with other organizations to provide holistic justice services and expand their reach. Currently, there appears to be a significant gap between innovation needed in the grassroots and legal tech innovation; and each organization and justicemaker that seeks to connect is required to do it individually. 

### Opportunities for the field of Law & Justice
Recognizing the citizen/individual need for a holistic experience in accessing the justice ecosystem, organizations are keen to interconnect and enable the discovery of multiple legal service providers, particularly of services that they do not yet provide or intend to provide. 
 
Enabling interconnectedness and discovery of legal service providers helps with: 
 
1. **Increased discoverability of Legal Service Providers**: While institutions and ecosystems adoption of various legal services is growing exponentially, end individuals aren’t familiar with many legal services. Also, today an individual can discover a legal service provider only if both of them are on the same platform, this is called "Coincidence of Presence". Legal service providers are naturally discoverable by implementing the protocol as any end user-facing (seeker) application can access them. That means an individual does not have to specifically sign up for a Legal Service Provider. They can remain on the application of their choice and discover legal service providers based on a unified/common language. 

2. **Increased choice for individuals**: Users can send personalized search queries to receive customized offerings, including languages, services, and cost, from legal service providers.  
3. **Lower costs of doing business**: Seeker platforms can focus on providing the best experience for their users, and provider platforms can focus on better services without having to worry about CAC. 
4. **Non-linear innovation**: Legal service providers can provide value-added services over and above their current offerings by connecting to other downstream networks.  
5. **Secure and consent based data exchange**: Currently, parties to a legal service order are required to manually upload documents multiple times or parties to an order lose time when documents need to be transferred from one platform or place to another. This allows parties to an order to transfer documents as needed, when necessary. Privacy and data security is part of the Protocol design. 
6. **Enhanced trust in transactions & User Experience**: Parties to a legal service order aren’t always able to track their disputes or keep a digital record of online transactions, particularly when a business or enterprise is handling hundreds of orders. The protocol enables trust in transactions, allows parties to track the status and updates of a dispute, and prioritizes the user experience in discovering a provider and initiating a service.

**About the PULSE Specification** - To tap into the opportunities described above, a group of volunteers has come together to design a unified protocol to unify the discovery and engagement of various legal services through an interoperable API specification to scale citizen access to justice, with discovery of Online Dispute Resolution service providers as the first use PULSE is an adaptation of [Beckn Protocol](https://github.com/beckn/protocol-specifications) that establishes a framework to arrive at this community-owned transaction standard for discovering legal services. Implementing the PULSE protocol will enable ecosystems/institutions seeking various legal services to easily discover and engage with multiple legal service providers.
