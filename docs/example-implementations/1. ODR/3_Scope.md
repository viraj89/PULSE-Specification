# Scope

This document outlines the various use cases that are in and out of scope for this specification.

## Use Cases In Scope

This version of the specification for law and justice covers dispute resolution using technology and alternate dispute resolution services such as mediation arbitration and conciliation.

1. **Arbitration**: Arbitration is a method of resolving disputes between two or more parties outside of the court system. In arbitration, the parties agree to present their case to one or more neutral individuals known as arbitrators.
2. **Conciliation**: Conciliation is also a voluntary dispute resolution process, and the parties can choose to participate or opt-out at any stage. The conciliator actively investigates the issues and if both parties agree to a settlement, the conciliator will typically formalise the settlement agreement.
3. **Mediation**: Mediation is a method of resolving conflicts or disagreements between two or more parties with the help of a neutral third party called a mediator. The mediator facilitates the process and does not make decisions or impose solutions but instead helps the parties communicate and find a mutually agreeable resolution. The outcome of mediation is non-binding.

## Use Cases Out of Scope

Use cases outside of ODR services, such as legal counseling for legal advice, or legal services such as discovering a lawyer or other professionals are currently out of scope for this version.
